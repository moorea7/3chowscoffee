          <h2>My Love of Coffee</h2>
          <p>My love of coffee started early. Growing up in England, that often meant instant coffee — it was simply what was available. But everything changed once I got to university. There, I discovered <strong>real coffee</strong>, and I dove headfirst into experimenting with every brewing method I could find.</p>
          <p>I tried everything from <strong>hand-grinding beans</strong> to brewing in a classic <strong>moka pot</strong>, learning how each technique brought out different flavors and textures. Those experiments sparked a curiosity that stayed with me, laying the foundation for what would eventually become my passion for roasting.</p>

          <h2>Early Coffee Work</h2>
          <p>After university, one of my first jobs was teaching at a college. To help supplement my income, I also worked part-time in a <strong>small coffee shop that roasted its own beans</strong>.</p>
          <p>That experience was eye-opening — it was the first time I saw coffee taken from green to roasted, and it gave me an inside look at the care and craft that goes into every batch. It was <strong>drilled into me that roasting isn’t just about applying heat — it’s about bringing out the unique character of each bean</strong>.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I learned how to make <strong>great brewed coffee and espresso</strong>. My mentor insisted that I <strong>pull shot after shot — and taste every one — until the consistency was right</strong>. That discipline trained my palate to recognize balance, nuance, and quality in the cup.</p>
          <p>Before I ever began roasting myself, <strong>Maria — then early in our relationship — took me to visit coffee farms in her home country of Indonesia</strong>. I was fascinated watching small farms <strong>pick, roast, and sell their coffee to both locals and tourists alike</strong>. Those early visits, and many return trips since, gave me a deep appreciation for coffee at its source and broadened my perspective on its global culture.</p>

          <h2>How I Started Roasting</h2>
          <p>My roasting journey began when I backed an <strong>Indiegogo campaign for the Roma Pro roaster</strong>. At first, I experimented with its automatic modes, but it didn’t take long before I wanted more control. I connected the Roma Pro to <strong>Artisan</strong> to log temperatures and track roast curves in real time.</p>
          <p>When the Roma Pro went down for repairs, I picked up a <strong>Skywalker roaster</strong>, which runs on <strong>Hibean</strong>. That setup gave me even greater visibility and control, allowing me to fine-tune heat, airflow, and timing with precision.</p>
          <p>Still to this day, I roast in <strong>small 500-gram batches</strong>, continuing to hone the craft with the same curiosity and care that first drew me in.</p>

          <h2>From Hobby to Craft</h2>
          <p>As I got deeper into roasting, <strong>“better than store” coffee</strong> quickly became the norm. Friends and family didn’t want to wait for gifts — they asked to <strong>buy</strong> my coffee directly. Their encouragement pushed me from hobbyist to small-batch roaster.</p>
          <p>Along the way, <strong>Maria — my wife, a coffee lover from Indonesia, and chief brand ambassador — brought her business background into the picture</strong>. She championed Three Chows from the beginning: introducing me to Indonesia’s coffee culture, sharing beans with her fellow teachers and friends, and <strong>always reminding me about the sales and marketing side</strong> so this passion could grow.</p>

          <h2>The Name: Three Chows</h2>
          <p>When I met Maria, I quickly fell in love — not only with her, but also with <strong>her chow chows</strong>. Their loyal, dignified (and sometimes stubborn) personalities fit our home perfectly. Over the years we’ve had a few, but our current three — <strong>Cowboy, Bruno, and Riri</strong> — are ever-present. They’re usually right outside the roasting-room door; they know this is something I love to do and want to be there when it’s happening.</p>
          <p>Naming the venture <strong>Three Chows Coffee Company</strong> felt natural — a tribute to the dogs that bring so much joy to our lives, and to the warmth and companionship coffee represents.</p>

        <h2>Roasting Philosophy &amp; Mission</h2>
        <p>At Three Chows, I believe coffee is at its best when it <strong>expresses the unique character of each bean</strong>. Every roast is guided by both data and intuition — science and craft working together to highlight sweetness, balance, and the story of origin.</p>
        <p>My mission is simple: to share <strong>fresh, small-batch coffee roasted with care</strong>. Coffee that connects people, sparks joy, and brings the same sense of comfort and companionship as the three chows who inspired its name.</p>

          <h2>Seattle Roots</h2>
          <p>We live in <strong>Seattle</strong> — a city known for <strong>coffee, beer, the outdoors, and dogs</strong> — the perfect home for Three Chows. The culture here celebrates craft, quality, and community, the same values at the heart of every bag I roast. Whether I’m dialing in a roast curve or heading outside with the dogs, Seattle provides the backdrop that inspires this journey.</p>
